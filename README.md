# French Flashcard Game

A fun and interactive flashcard game to learn 1,000 French words. The game uses a timer to display a French word, and after 3 seconds, reveals its English translation. Players can mark whether they knew the word or not. Words you know will not appear again, helping you focus on the ones you need to learn!
